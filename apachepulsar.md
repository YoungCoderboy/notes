# WHY?

- The barrier between consumer format and producer format
- The barrier between consumer protocol and producer protocol
- load is increase with each increasing connection between producer and consumer

- pulsar is middleware that accept the information from the producer
- consumer then source their data from the middleware, Pulsar

- Pulsar has two layers 

1. Service Level (pulsar)
2. Storage Level
