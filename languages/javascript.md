# Introduction

javascript is light weight interpreted language
JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

## Prototype Based?

Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, less frequently, adding them to an empty object.

Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming where objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype object. Unlike class-based programming, there's no explicit "class" definition. Instead, objects are created by referencing existing objects and inheriting their functionality.

**Here's how it works in JavaScript:**

1. **Prototype Object:** Every function in JavaScript has a hidden property called `prototype`. This prototype object acts as a blueprint for objects created using that function. You can add properties and methods to the prototype to define the default behavior for all objects created from that function.

2. **Creating Objects:** Objects are typically created using constructor functions. These functions act like blueprints that specify the properties and methods of the object being created. When you call a constructor function with the `new` keyword, a new object is created, and its internal prototype is set to the constructor function's prototype object.

**Example:**

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Add a method to the Person.prototype
Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
};

// Create objects using the Person constructor
const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
const person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

// Access properties and methods
console.log(person1.name); // Output: Alice
console.log(person2.age); // Output: 25
person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice

// Inherited method
person2.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Bob
```

**Explanation:**

- We define a `Person` constructor function that takes `name` and `age` as arguments.
- We add a `greet` method to the `Person.prototype`. This method is inherited by all objects created using the `Person` constructor.
- We create two objects, `person1` and `person2`, using the `new Person` syntax.
- Both objects inherit the `name`, `age`, and `greet` method from the `Person.prototype`.

**Benefits of Prototype-Based Programming:**

- **Flexibility:** It allows for dynamic object creation and inheritance without strictly defined classes.
- **Code Reusability:** By adding methods to prototypes, you can share functionality across objects easily.
- **Simpler Syntax:** Compared to class-based languages, prototype-based programming can have a simpler syntax for object creation and inheritance.

**Drawbacks:**

- **Can Be Less Intuitive:** For those familiar with class-based programming, the prototype-based approach might seem less intuitive initially.
- **Potential for Naming Conflicts:** Since properties and methods are added directly to prototypes, there's a risk of naming conflicts if you're not careful.

**In conclusion, prototype-based programming is a fundamental concept in JavaScript. By understanding how prototypes and inheritance work, you can create reusable and well-structured object-oriented code in your JavaScript applications.**
